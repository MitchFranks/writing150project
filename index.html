    By "Concord Archway"
<br><br>
“Concord” signifies agreement or harmony between groups or people. The word “Archway” Symbolizes a gateway or bridge, which represents the connection being formed between the two arguing parties in the painting.
<br><br>
This image portrays various political parties in a state of argument and conflict, emphasizing the divide between them. The landscape shows groups on either side of a chasm, with a partially built bridge symbolizing the potential for unity and the need to work towards coming together. The stormy sky and fractured earth reinforce the urgency of overcoming discord to seek common ground. This image serves as a visual metaphor for the current state of political division and the critical need for change. You will see an elephant and a donkey which represent the political parties we have today with deformed animals next to them symbolizing that there is no room for differing political views in our world today.

In June of 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that had legalized abortion since 1973, reignited intense debates around the issue. This decision has polarized opinions, making it evident how entrenched individuals are in their viewpoints, often unwilling to reconsider or modify their stances. As a result, having open, constructive discussions about abortion, as well as other controversial topics, has become increasingly challenging. The deep-seated convictions held by each side create a significant barrier to dialogue, making it difficult to engage in meaningful conversations that could lead to progressive changes or mutual understanding in today’s politically divided climate.

                            <p class="mb-0">In 2023 over a million abortions were performed throughout the United States. This is a tragedy that can only be fixed if we decide to come together and make a progressive change that everyone can agree with. In an article put out by Dianne Duke Williams—citing a study by investigators at Washington University—she reveals that “by providing birth control to women at no cost substantially reduces unplanned pregnancies and cuts abortion rates by a range of 62 to 78 percent compared to the national rate.” This would be monumental and it's something that everyone could and should agree with.
