                            Vita is Latin for “Life” and Arboris is Latin for “tree”

                            This symbolic image captures the essence of valuing all forms of human life. It features a large tree with branches extending outward, each branch cradling figures that represent the diversity of humanity—encompassing different ages, cultures, abilities, and backgrounds. The lush flora beneath the tree and the warm sunlight above symbolize the beauty and diversity of life, as well as the interconnectedness and equal value of every individual. This scene embodies a message of inclusion, respect, and the universal importance of cherishing all human life.
                            <br><br>The ethical debate on abortion centers around the contentious issue of whether a fetus qualifies as a "person" with rights, reminiscent of historical injustices where subjective criteria stripped certain groups of personhood, leading to atrocities such as slavery and genocides. Applying similar logic to abortion, especially in cases involving potential disabilities, sets a dangerous precedent. Citing Russell M. Nelson, the argument emphasizes the immorality of devaluing lives based on physical or mental capabilities. It asserts that all lives, irrespective of conditions or developmental stages, inherently hold value. This perspective calls for broader acknowledgment and protection of life, advocating for compassionate solutions that respect life's undeniable worth while addressing ethical dilemmas in reproductive choices.

                            The word “Elysian” is often used to describe perfect peace and happiness, similar to paradise. “Gather” directly refers to the act of coming together, emphasizing the collective action and unity depicted in the artwork.

                            This image captures the theme of unity and coming together to foster progressive change. The scene depicts a circle of diverse human figures, each representing different ethnicities, ages, and backgrounds, holding hands around a growing sapling. This sapling symbolizes new beginnings and the potential for growth through collective effort, set against a backdrop of a rising sun that represents hope and the dawn of new possibilities. The image uses warm and inviting colors to emphasize the power of unity in driving positive societal changes.

                            In the abortion debate, bridging the divide between pro-life and pro-choice perspectives hinges on our ability to find common ground in shared values of compassion and respect for life. Both sides care deeply: the pro-life movement views the unborn as sacred and deserving of protection, while the pro-choice advocates emphasize the health and safety of women. A practical step towards consensus could involve making contraception widely accessible, which has been shown to significantly reduce unplanned pregnancies and abortions by 62 to 78 percent. Such measures not only alleviate the need for abortions but also foster a cooperative environment where progress can be made without conflict. As President Nelson articulated, adopting a peacemaker's approach, devoid of anger and contention, is essential for inspiring solutions that uphold dignity and foster unity, transcending individual beliefs to achieve collective well-being and societal progress.

                            “Vitae” is a Latin word for life tying into the fundamental aspect of birth control and “Clavis” is Latin for the word “key”, which is perfect seeing how birth control is the key to the abortion solution.

                            This image shows contraception as a beacon of hope and a solution for societal problems. The scene features a large, glowing pill or contraceptive device at the center, casting light over a blend of urban and natural landscapes. This represents empowerment and the widespread impact of accessible birth control, highlighting its role in fostering individual choices and preventing unintended pregnancies. The background merges cityscapes with natural settings, using soft, warm colors to convey a message of peace and proactive solutions. In each artwork, the viewer's attention is instinctively drawn to the center of the image, emphasizing that contraception should be a central focus in the abortion debate. By making birth control more accessible to all women, we can significantly reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies.

                            Increasing access to birth control is a key solution to solve many issues related to abortion. By making contraception widely available and free, studies indicate a potential reduction in unplanned pregnancies by 62 to 78 percent, thereby decreasing abortion rates significantly. This approach bridges the gap between pro-life advocates, who cherish the sanctity of the unborn, and pro-choice supporters, who prioritize women’s health and autonomy. Such preventative measures can alleviate the need for abortions and foster a societal consensus on reproductive responsibility. Promoting accessible contraception offers a practical and compassionate strategy to prevent disputes and enhance understanding across diverse perspectives, ultimately leading to healthier societal outcomes and reduced contention around abortion. Easier access to birth control is the key to once and for all ending the abortion debate.
